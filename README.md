Rust_GL_Stuff
--

This application is mainly for self-learning and exploration of the world of Rust.

While implementing I try to:
 - Write ~~safe~~unsafe rust code
 - Take design decisions as if they were for a ~~larger~~smaller codebase
 - ~~Not~~ cheat in implementations ... too much


Since I wrote this the first time I have changed my mind.
New goals:
- Implement towards gfx_rust
- The current goal is oriented towards a particle system
  - The goal itself is not the particle system, but rather I use the particle system as an excuse of learning the language.
